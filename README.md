### 🎲 Mancala

💡 This project was so much fun to work on. I have taken a lot of valuable technical lessons from it, particularly using other libraries in React projects, working with state, taking user input and storing in variables, and much more.

## 📜 Project explanation

🪚 The project is made of one main App component and the Mancala component, where the UI is rendered and all the interactivity takes place.

- There are two input fields, where the user sets the number of both pits and stones to add to the game. The input is stored in state variables that are then accessed to render the components n times based on those values. 
- There are two button components, which trigger an event handler that renders the pits and stones components.
- The user can then drag the stones components throughout the pits components, just like the original Mancala game.

## 🧰 The frontend is comprised of

- React.js - used to render the UI 
- React-Draggable - used to make the stones components draggable
